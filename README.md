# JusChat
JusChat Welcomes you! Here, you'll find an impressive chat application built using React JS for the frontend and Node JS with Socket.io for the backend. With this application, users can engage in seamless text conversations, share images, express themselves with emojis, and even spice up their chats with GIFs, all within various chat rooms.

To enhance the user experience, automated messages are in place to notify participants when someone joins or leaves a room. Furthermore, a user status feature is integrated, allowing you to see who's currently online in each room.
